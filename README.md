## üéØ What This App Does

This calculator helps ENS DAO stewards understand their token compensation by:

- **Real-time Price Integration**: Fetches current $ENS prices from CoinGecko API
- **Automatic Calculations**: Converts USD compensation to token amounts using 6-month averages
- **Vesting Visualization**: Shows 2-year linear vesting schedule with clear breakdowns
- **Role Comparison**: Switch between Steward ($48K) and Lead Steward ($66K) compensation
- **Transparent Breakdown**: See exactly how token allocations are calculated

## üö® Important Notes

**Future Date Handling**: Since the calculation period (Jan 1 - July 1, 2025) is in the future, the app uses current $ENS price data as projections and clearly labels all estimates.

**Educational Purpose**: This is a transparency tool for ENS DAO stewards. Official compensation decisions are governed by ENS DAO governance processes, not this calculator.

**Price Volatility**: Token allocations will fluctuate with $ENS price changes until the 6-month averaging period begins.
